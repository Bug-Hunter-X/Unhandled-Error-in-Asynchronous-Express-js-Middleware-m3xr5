# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors during asynchronous operations within request handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where asynchronous data processing within a POST route doesn't handle potential errors. This can lead to application crashes or silent failures, making debugging difficult.

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by using `async/await` and a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle any exceptions that might occur during asynchronous data processing. This ensures that the application remains stable even if errors arise, and provides better error handling for a more robust application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run `node bug.js`.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with some JSON data in the body.  Observe the console logs.
6.  Modify the `processData` function in `bug.js` to introduce an error (e.g., accessing a non-existent property) to simulate a failure.
7. Repeat steps 4 and 5.  Note the lack of error handling in the original code.
8. Repeat the process with `bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.

## Key improvements in bugSolution.js

- **Asynchronous Error Handling:** The solution uses `async/await` and a `try...catch` block to properly handle potential errors during the asynchronous `processData` function.
- **Error Reporting:**  The `catch` block provides more informative error handling, logging the error and sending an appropriate error response to the client.
